# Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains various machine learning projects focusing on different aspects of predictive modeling and analysis. The following projects are included:

## Projects

### 1. **Comprehensive Stock Market Analysis and Prediction System**
   - **Description**: This project analyzes historical stock market data to predict future stock prices. It uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and applies both machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning (LSTM) models to make predictions. The models' performance is evaluated using RMSE.
   - **Techniques Used**:
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Random Forest
     - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
     - Model Evaluation: RMSE
     
### 2. **Predicting Experimental LogS Values Using Regression Models**
   - **Description**: The project predicts experimental LogS (solubility) values by first using linear regression and then applying Random Forest to capture non-linear relationships. The performance of both models is compared using RMSE.
   - **Techniques Used**:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Model Evaluation: RMSE

### 3. **Predicting Number of Medals a Country Will Win in the Summer Olympics**
   - **Description**: This project aims to predict the number of medals a country will win in the Summer Olympics. Using linear regression, historical data such as population, GDP, and past performance are used to train the model. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using RMSE.
   - **Techniques Used**:
     - Linear Regression
     - Model Evaluation: RMSE
